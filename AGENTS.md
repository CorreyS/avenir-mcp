# Agent contract

This file tells an automated agent how to work in this repository. It is the
contract; `CLAUDE.md` points here. The rules apply to humans as well.

## What the code is

An MCP server between an agent and the YNAB API. Four modules:

- `client.py` talks HTTP to YNAB and is the only place that knows about milliunits
  on the way in
- `analytics.py` and `classifier.py` compute; they never call the network
  themselves
- `server.py` declares the MCP tools and nothing else

## Rules that hold everywhere

**No secret, ever.** The YNAB token grants full write access to a person's
budgets. It is never logged, printed, returned in a tool result or committed.
`tests/test_hygiene.py` fails on an IBAN, a token or a bank statement in the tree.

**No real financial data.** Fixtures use invented accounts, payees and amounts.
A test that needs realistic data gets invented realistic data. Documentation
examples come only from `python -m docsgen`, which runs avenir-mcp on the invented demo
budget in `evals/`: never paste an answer from a real budget.

**Tool output is for an agent.** Keep it short, name things plainly, and say in the
docstring when to use the tool and what unit its amounts are in. A tool description
is part of the interface: change it with the same care as a signature.

**Writes are consequential.** A tool that modifies a budget says so in its
docstring. The roadmap makes every write previewable and undoable; do not add a
write path that would be hard to fit into that.

**Transaction text is untrusted.** Memos and payee names come from banks and
strangers. Return them as data; never splice them into instructions.

**stdout belongs to the protocol.** In stdio mode, anything else written to stdout
corrupts the session. Diagnostics go through `logging`, on stderr.

**Docstrings follow the Google style, complete.** Every function says what it
does, then its `Args:`, `Returns:` and `Raises:`; `ruff check avenir_mcp` enforces
it. For a tool, the text before these sections is what the agent reads: FastMCP
turns `Args:` into the parameters' descriptions and drops the rest. A resource
passes its description to the decorator, since FastMCP would show its sections.

**Structured data is a pydantic model.** Tool arguments, tool results and journal
entries derive from `avenir_mcp.model.Model`: unknown fields are refused, and each
field's docstring becomes its description in the schema. Data from the YNAB API
stays a dict until a tool turns it into a result.

**Every operation of YNAB's API is accounted for.** `api/ynab-operations.json` is a
snapshot of YNAB's specification; the operations a tool uses are found in the code,
and `api/coverage.toml` says why each other one is planned or left out. A tool that
starts using an operation removes it from `coverage.toml`; `tests/test_api_coverage.py`
fails otherwise, and when the client calls a path YNAB does not document. A weekly
workflow fails when YNAB changes its API: `uv run python -m docsgen.api --update`,
then classify what changed.

**Every rule YNAB states on what a tool sends is accounted for.** The snapshot also
keeps the rules the specification writes in each field's description ("not
supported for…", "cannot be combined with…", "will be ignored") and each maximum
length. `api/constraints.toml` gives each rule of an operation a tool uses its
tests, the reason it does not apply, or marks it a gap; `tests/test_api_constraints.py`
fails otherwise. Before writing a tool that sends YNAB a new body, read its rules
there: each one becomes a test before the tool is written. A fake YNAB in the tests
refuses what YNAB refuses, or a test of the refusal proves nothing.

**A secret is never a plain string.** The YNAB token and AVENIR_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN
become a pydantic `SecretStr` where they are read, and `get_secret_value()` is
called only where the value is sent or compared. A secret field of a model is a
`SecretStr` too. Printed, logged or in a repr, a secret shows as `**********`.
The one exception is the token avenir-mcp makes for the HTTP transport when
AVENIR_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN is unset: it is printed once on stderr, never logged, so the
user can give it to a client.

**Few dependencies.** `fastmcp` and `httpx`, pinned, and `pydantic`, which fastmcp
already requires. Adding one needs a reason written in the pull request.

**Tests come first.** Write the failing test, watch it fail, then write the code.
Coverage is enforced at 100 %, branches included.

## Before opening a pull request

```bash
uv sync
just check              # lint, types, tests at 100 %, vocabulary, lockfile
uv run python -m docsgen  # when a tool, resource, prompt or answer changed
just docs               # the site builds in every language, every link valid
just links              # every link of the README and the docs leads somewhere (Docker)
just docker             # the image builds and the container lists its tools (Docker)
```

A test fails when the generated tool reference or an example no longer matches the
code, and when a hand-written page is missing in a translation. When a change affects how an agent uses the tools, run
`just evaluate` (a real agent on the demo budget) and commit its report.
