# avenir-mcp — an unofficial MCP server for YNAB

Self-checked on every change against YNAB's API terms of 2025-05-28 (naming, attribution,
YNAB's own image, a personal token for its owner only, the hourly limit); a weekly job
turns the badge red when YNAB changes its terms. Listed by YNAB in its
[Works with YNAB](https://api.ynab.com/#works-with-ynab-third-party) directory, among
third-party apps. Not endorsed by YNAB.

Built and tested against YNAB's API v1.87.0. A weekly [`YNAB API drift`](https://github.com/mathbeal/avenir-mcp/actions/workflows/api-drift.yml) check compares it with the live specification and fails when YNAB publishes a new version.

> 🇬🇧 **avenir-mcp** (*avenir* is French for *the future*) lets an AI agent read your YNAB plan

> 🇫🇷 **avenir-mcp** permet à un agent IA de lire votre plan YNAB et de vous aider

Ask Claude — or any [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) client — about your plan
in plain words: where the money went, what still needs a category, whether an account
matches the bank, when money would run out. Every change is previewed, confirmed by
you, and can be undone.

All four come from the invented demo plan: the write above is replayed by `python -m docsgen`,
so every line of it is what avenir-mcp answers today; then a real reply of Claude Sonnet, and
the net worth and the forecast the documentation shows. The demo plays for thirty seconds and
holds its last frame, which tells the whole story on its own: a reader whose system asks for
less motion, or a viewer that does not animate, sees that frame instead.

## Why avenir-mcp

- **Tools for tasks, not endpoints.** Classify a month of transactions, reconcile an
  account, forecast your balance: one tool each, not a wrapper of YNAB's API.
- **Read-only by default.** Tools that change your plan exist only when you enable
  them.
- **Preview, confirm, undo.** Every write shows what will change and waits for your
  yes; `undo_operation` reverts it.
- **Answers an agent can read.** Currency units, short typed answers, pagination,
  errors that say what to fix, bank text treated as untrusted.
- **Verified.** 100 % line and branch coverage, and an evaluation where a real agent
  works on an invented plan: 25/25 tasks.

## Install

You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and a YNAB personal access token
(YNAB → Account Settings → Developer Settings → New Token).

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_avenir--mcp-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=avenir-mcp&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22ynab_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22YNAB%20personal%20access%20token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22uvx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22avenir-mcp%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22YNAB_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Aynab_token%7D%22%7D%7D)
[![Install in Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=avenir-mcp&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoidXZ4IiwiYXJncyI6WyJhdmVuaXItbWNwIl0sImVudiI6eyJZTkFCX0FQSV9LRVkiOiJ5b3VyLXRva2VuIn19)

One click installs avenir-mcp **read-only**: VS Code asks for your token in a password box and keeps it in its secret
storage; in Cursor, replace `your-token` in the server's settings. Add `AVENIR_MCP_WRITE=1` to allow changes.

Or by hand:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add avenir-mcp --env YNAB_API_KEY=your-token --env AVENIR_MCP_WRITE=1 -- uvx avenir-mcp
```

```jsonc
// Claude Desktop, Cursor: the mcpServers block of the client's configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "avenir-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["avenir-mcp"],
      "env": { "YNAB_API_KEY": "your-token", "AVENIR_MCP_WRITE": "1" }
    }
  }
}
```

Drop `AVENIR_MCP_WRITE` to stay read-only. Other clients and every option:

## Claude Code plugin

`plugin/` is avenir-mcp as a Claude Code plugin: Claude Code asks for your YNAB token in
the plugin's settings, keeps it out of sight, and starts the server from the plugin's own
locked environment. From a clone: `claude --plugin-dir plugin`.

| The plugin | What |
|---|---|
| runs | `uv run --locked --project` *the plugin's folder*, which starts the release `plugin/pyproject.toml` pins, and nothing else. No script of its own, no build step, no hook, no shell |
| contacts | `pypi.org` and `files.pythonhosted.org`, to install that release and the versions `plugin/uv.lock` pins, the first time; then `api.ynab.com`, with your token, as avenir-mcp always does |
| writes | the environment `uv` resolves inside the plugin's folder, and `uv`'s own cache. Nothing elsewhere |
| changes in your plan | nothing. It starts avenir-mcp read-only: `AVENIR_MCP_WRITE` is not set, so the tools that change a plan are never registered |

## What you can ask

| You ask | avenir-mcp |
|---|---|
| "Which category is overspent this month?" | `get_monthly_summary` — totals and overspent categories |
| "Categorise what is pending." | `suggest_categories`, then `apply_categories` after your yes |
| "Split this receipt: 81.15 groceries, 5.25 household." | `split_transaction` — one transaction across categories, after your yes |
| "Which transaction is my 86.40 receipt from the 12th?" | `find_transactions` — by dates, exact amount and account, categorised or not |
| "My bank shows 3,440.80. Does YNAB agree?" | `reconcile_account` — explains the gap, changes nothing until it matches |
| "Will I go below zero before December?" | `forecast_balance` — month by month, with its assumptions |
| "Am I paying off my debts?" | `get_net_worth_trend` — assets, debts and net worth at each month end |
| "If I lost my income, how long could I last?" | `get_runway` — months the money in the budget covers the usual spending |
| "How much of my income do I keep?" | `get_savings_rate` — income, spending, saved and rate, month by month |
| "Which targets are behind this month?" | `get_underfunded_targets` — what each still needs, most urgent first, against Ready to Assign |
| "When will my debts be paid off if I put 500 a month on them?" | `get_debt_payoff_plan` — avalanche or snowball, the month each debt is paid off and the interest |
| "How old is my money?" | `get_age_of_money` — YNAB's Age of Money month by month, and its trend |
| "Move 30 from Tennis to Restaurants." | `set_category_budget`, previewed and undoable |
| "Undo that." | `undo_operation` |

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathbeal/avenir-mcp && cd avenir-mcp
uv sync
just check        # lint, types, tests at 100 % coverage, vocabulary, lockfile
just docs-serve   # the documentation, live
just evaluate     # a real agent on the demo plan (uses your Claude plan)
```

## Privacy Policy

avenir-mcp is a program you run yourself, not a service: its publisher runs no server and
receives none of your data. Your token is read from the environment, kept in memory as a
secret value and sent only to YNAB; your plan's data is fetched when a tool needs it, kept
in memory, and returned to your agent, which means the model provider your MCP client
sends tool results to also sees it. Nothing is sold, and nothing goes to a third party
this does not name. What is handled, how long it is kept and how to erase it:
