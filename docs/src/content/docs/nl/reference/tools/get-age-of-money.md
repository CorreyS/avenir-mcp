## Doel

YNAB's Age of Money: how old the money spent is today, and its trend month by month.

Use it for "how old is my money?", "am I living on last month's income?" or "is my
buffer growing?". The figure is YNAB's own, in days: how long, on average, money
stayed in the budget accounts before being spent, the oldest money spent first. Over
30 days means living on last month's income. months_count counts back from the
current month, included, so 1 gives this month alone and the default 12 the year up
to it; a plan that holds fewer months gives those, and says so in the notes. The
answer gives each month's figure, the latest, the change and its direction over the
period. A month YNAB had not enough history for comes back null, not as an error,
and the notes name those months. Relay the notes with the figures. For how
long the money would last without income use get_runway. One YNAB request, the list
of months; changes nothing.
