## What it does

List the plan's accounts with their balances, bank link and last reconciliation.

Use it to tell the user when a bank link is broken (no transaction comes in until
they fix it in YNAB) or when an account has not been reconciled for months. Its
ids are the account_ids other tools take. Balances are in currency units, today's:
cleared_balance is the part the bank has shown.
reconcile_account compares one account with the balance the bank shows.
For the balances of the months before use get_net_worth_trend; for the months
ahead, forecast_balance. With several plans, pass the plan id from list_plans:
'last-used' follows the plan last opened in YNAB. Every account comes in one
response, closed ones included, in one YNAB request; changes nothing.

## Behaviour

| | |
|---|---|
| Kind | read-only |
| Confirmation | no |
| Undo | no |
| Idempotent | yes |
| YNAB requests | 1 for the example below, on a cold cache |

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `plan_id` | string | yes | — | YNAB plan id or 'last-used'. |

## Returns

`array of object`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | YNAB id of the account. |
| `name` | string | Account name. |
| `type` | string | YNAB account type, e.g. checking, savings, creditCard, otherAsset. |
| `on_budget` | boolean | False for a tracking account, whose transactions take no category. |
| `closed` | boolean | True when the account is closed in YNAB. |
| `balance` | number | Balance of all transactions. |
| `cleared_balance` | number | Balance of the transactions the bank has shown. |
| `uncleared_balance` | number | Balance of the transactions the bank has not shown yet. |
| `bank_link` | "healthy" \| "broken" \| "none" | Whether YNAB imports this account from the bank: broken means the connection needs the user's attention in YNAB, and no new transaction will come in until then. |
| `last_reconciled` | string \| null | Date (YYYY-MM-DD) of the last reconciliation, or None if never reconciled. |
