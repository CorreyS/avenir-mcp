## What it does

A month at a glance: income, budgeted, spent, Ready to Assign, overspent categories.

Use it first to review a month. Give month as the first day of a month,
YYYY-MM-01; any other day is refused. 'current' is the month in progress: its
figures are partial, and already count what is entered for the days left.
Amounts in currency units; activity is negative for spending. Only overspent
categories are listed: for every category use get_category_balances; for the
months before, get_spending_trends; for the months ahead, forecast_balance.
One YNAB request; changes nothing.

  "plan_id": "demo-budget",
  "month": "2026-09-01"
}
```

Answer on the demo budget:

```json
{
  "month": "2026-09-01",
  "income": 0.0,
  "budgeted": 2490.99,
  "activity": -1230.68,
  "ready_to_assign": 0.0,
  "age_of_money": 47,
  "overspent": [
    {
      "category_id": "cat-restaurants",
      "name": "Restaurants",
      "group": "Everyday",
      "balance": -22.5
    }
  ]
}
```

## Errors

- `month must be 'current' or the first day of a month as YYYY-MM-01, got '{month}'.`

YNAB's own errors come back as `Error calling tool '<tool>': YNAB <status>: <detail>`.
