## What it does

List all YNAB plans accessible with the current API key.

A plan is what YNAB now calls a budget, and what users may still call their budget.
Use the plan id in subsequent tool calls. 'last-used' also works, but names
whichever plan was last opened in YNAB: with several plans, pass the id.
Call it once and keep the id; no other tool reads this list. For what a plan holds,
get_monthly_summary gives the month, list_accounts the accounts.

## Behaviour

| | |
|---|---|
| Kind | read-only |
| Confirmation | no |
| Undo | no |
| Idempotent | yes |
| YNAB requests | 1 for the example below, on a cold cache |

## Parameters

none.

## Returns

`array of object`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | YNAB id of the plan, to pass as plan_id. |
| `name` | string | Plan name. |
| `first_month` | string \| null | First month with data, YYYY-MM-01; null for an empty plan. |
| `last_month` | string \| null | Last month with data, YYYY-MM-01; null for an empty plan. |

## Example

Arguments:

```json
{}
```

Answer on the demo budget:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "demo-budget",
    "name": "Demo household",
    "first_month": "2026-06-01",
    "last_month": "2026-09-01"
  }
]
```

## Errors

This tool raises no error of its own; YNAB's errors come back as `Error calling tool '<tool>': YNAB <status>: <detail>`.
