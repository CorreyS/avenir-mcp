## Qué hace

How much of the income was kept, month by month: income, spending, saved, rate.

Use it for "what's my savings rate?", "how much do I put aside each month?" or "am
I saving more than last spring?". Income is money in categorised to Ready to Assign
on the budget accounts; starting balances and transfers are not income. Spending is
money out of the budget accounts less refunds (money in categorised to a spending
category); transfers between budget accounts are left out, a transfer to a tracking
account holding an asset (savings, investments) is saved, a transfer to a tracking
loan is spending. Saved is income plus spending; rate is saved over income, in
percent, null for a month without income. Complete months only, from the budget's
first transaction. Relay the notes with the figures. Amounts in currency units,
spending negative. For spending per category use get_spending_trends. Three YNAB
requests: accounts, categories, transactions; changes nothing.
