## Zweck

Project the balance month by month and say when money would run out.

Starts from today's balance of the open on-budget accounts (or those given).
For the current month, what was already spent or received since the 1st is
deducted from the monthly averages, so only what is left is projected.
Assumes, and returns as `assumptions` so the user can correct them: YNAB's
scheduled transactions on their dates, whatever their frequency, a yearly bill
included, charges that recur in the last 4 months (same payee, stable amount),
the average of all other spending over the last 3 months, and what you pass.
A payee with a schedule is projected by that schedule alone, and transfers
between the projected accounts are left out. What you pass is the expected
monthly income (default: the last 3 months' non-recurring inflows, which may
include one-off money such as capital injections) and one-off amounts such as
a tax bill (negative) or a refund (positive). Amounts in currency units.
`lowest` is the lowest point within a month; `first_shortfall` is the first
month it goes below zero. For a month already gone use get_monthly_summary, or
get_spending_trends to compare several; for how long today's money would last
with no income at all, get_runway. Changes nothing.
