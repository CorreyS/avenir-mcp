"""YNAB's API against avenir-mcp: every operation classified, and YNAB's changes caught.

`api/ynab-operations.json` is a snapshot of the operations YNAB's OpenAPI
specification lists. The operations avenir-mcp uses are found by following the
code from each tool and resource to the HTTP client; `api/coverage.toml` says why
each other one is planned or left out. Tests check that every operation is one or
the other, and that the client calls only documented paths.

The snapshot also keeps, for each operation that takes a body, the rules the
specification states on what it takes: each sentence of a field's description that
limits it ("not supported", "cannot", "will be ignored"…) and each maximum length.
`api/constraints.toml` says, for every rule of an operation avenir-mcp uses, which
test covers it, why it does not apply, or that it is a known gap. A rule YNAB adds
or rewords is caught by the same weekly check.

`python -m docsgen.api` compares the snapshot with the live specification and fails
when YNAB added, removed or renamed an operation, or changed one of its rules;
`--update` rewrites the snapshot.
